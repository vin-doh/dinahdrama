<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> It was the day we moved away. It lay like a stone in my lap and no matter how I tried prying, tearing, it simply would not go away. I never knew emptiness until I moved away. I remained a pebble, lost in this world so vast and uncaring. Cast aside, passed by, left astray. I took steps to destroy it before it sapped me, crushed me, left me victim. I pulled harder, ripping that stone right from my heart, and threw it all back into the void from where it came. Yes, I had thrown loneliness away. <em>[She goes to sit after reading]</em>

    <strong>Levi:</strong> Thank you. Do you know what this shows me? That you're all capable of writing poetry. It's just a matter of making the effort. Don't forget, people, due Friday: dramatic dialogue being suffering loss, partner optional.

    <strong>Ama:</strong> So, you're a math genius, too? <em>[Ama and Charllote talking]</em>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Oh, hi, Ama.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> And some kind of frustrated poet just waiting to be discovered?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> I wouldn't say that.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> Well, Levi sure drooled over your poetry.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> So?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> So, I figured you're the one to help me with the class assignment.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> You mean the dramatic dialogue?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> Yeah, theme: suffering, loss. Anyway, I have to get an A on it.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Why? You're flunking English?
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> No, but I gotta pull my grades up in order to get into college, so I figure you're the one to help me with this.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> I was planning on working on it by myself.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> Come on, Charllote. Levi said we could use a partner.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Look, Ama, I'm sorry, but I like to work alone when I write.

    <strong>Ama:</strong> Going to her house wasn't exactly what I had in mind. But at the time, I couldn't think of any way to get out of it. And I have to admit, I was a little curious about this girl. We both had a serious case of writer's block.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> Levi drives me crazy with these assignments. I mean, what does suffering loss mean? <em>[Ama and Charllote continue talking]</em>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Didn't he say to me whatever we want it to mean, so we make something up?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> Like what?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Like when your parents make you move away, and you lose everything you care about?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> Tell me about it.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> What, you two?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> Hey, I wasn't always the picture of charming fashion that you see before you today. We used to live in a small house in a small town. And then Dad hit it big in the stock market and voila. Goodbye friends, hello loneliness. I don't know why I'm telling you all this.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> That's it.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> That's what?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> The loss. We do a dramatic dialogue about the loss of friendship.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> You mean about friends moving away?
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> No. A little too close to home.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> Then. How about because they've had a fight?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Fight about what?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Ama:</strong> Hellooo about guys. What else do girls fight about?

    <strong>Vincent:</strong> So, Proverbs 13:20 says. He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly. Now, when the Bible says stupid ones, it's not talking about people who are unintelligent, but about people who do not follow godly standards.

</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> OK, actually, most everyone's been pretty nice.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> Oh, that's good. Hey, listen, I'm having some friends over tonight. I want you to come. I actually made a cheesecake that I'm proud of.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> I'd love to, but I promise to go into the city with some friends.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> Oh, from our hall?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> No, from school, but they're just going to show me around the city. They're real nice.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> Look, I hope you don't mind me asking this, but how well do you really know these kids?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> What do you mean?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> I mean, do they have any interest in the Bible?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> I don't know, it hasn't come up, but they're not into drugs or anything like that. In fact, they're even nicer than some of the kids at the Kingdom Hall.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> Well, even if that were true, don't you think you have to be careful with people? People who may not even believe in the Bible? Don't forget what happened to Dinah.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Dinah?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> Yeah. You remember Jacob's daughter?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> These kids are not Canaanites. They're very nice.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> Maybe, but what are their beliefs? What are their morals?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> So, you're saying that I shouldn't be friendly with anyone in school who isn't a witness?
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> No, no, no, I'm not saying that at all. I mean, the Bible tells us to love our neighbors, but doesn't it also warn us that it's dangerous to get too close to certain people, people that don't follow God's standards? Dinah learned that the hard way. 
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> But don't we have to teach people about the Bible? How can I do that if I don't spend any time with them? 
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> Oh, so you have had a chance to witness to them?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Well, no, but that's not the point. Ama and her friends are not bad. 
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> OK, but do they encourage you to do good things? 
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Like?
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> Like personal study meetings, field service. 
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> No. Look, Allana, I've already given my word and Jesus did say I have to let my yes mean yes, right? 
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Allana:</strong> Charllote, do you really think Jesus meant saying yes to things that can hurt you? 
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
    <strong>Charllote:</strong> Allana, I'll be careful. I'm not going to do anything stupid, trust me.
